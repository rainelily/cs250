How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- For me, understanding user needs starts with listening carefully and then translating what people say they want into something technical and actionable. Users don't usually speak in code or system design, so user stories bridge that gap by framing their needs in plain language. When I'm given a request, I'm able to connect a real-world goal with a concrete development task. This makes it much easier to design and build features that actually solve the user's problem rather than just making assumptions.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- I approach development as an iterative process where it's okay to build small, test often, and adapt along the way. I don't expect the first version of anything I code to be perfect. What matters is delivering something functional and then improving it with feedback. The Agile processes I find most valuable are sprint planning and retrospectives. Planning keeps the work structured and realistic, while retrospectives give the team space to reflect and improve together. Going forward, I want to use these practices to stay flexible and continuously improve both my code and how I collaborate. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- Being a good team member means more than just writing good code. It's about communication, accountability, and respect. A strong team member shares progress openly, asks for help when needed, and steps in when others are stuck. it also means being adaptable and willing to compromoise for the sake of the project's success. I've learned that the best teams aren't the ones with just the best coders, but the ones where everyone trusts each other, contrubutes fairly, and stays aligned on the same goals.
